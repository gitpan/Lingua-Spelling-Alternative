NAME
    Alternative.pm - alternative spelling of a given word in a given
    language

SYNOPSIS
      use Lingua::Spelling:Alternative;

      my $en = new Alternative;
      $en->load_affix('/usr/lib/ispell/english.aff') or die $!;
      print $en->alternatives("cars");

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to return all valid forms of a given word (for
    example when you want to see all possible forms of some word entered in
    search engine)

PUBLIC METHODS
    new The new() constructor (without parameters) create container for new
        language. Only parametar it supports is DEBUG which turns on (some)
        debugging output.

    load_affix
        Function load_affix() loads ispell's affix file for later usage.

    load_findaffix
        This function loads output of findaffix program from ispell package.
        This is better idea (if you are creating affix file for particular
        language yourself or you can get your hands on one) because affix
        file from ispel is limited to 26 entries (because each entry is
        denoted by single character).

    alternatives
        Function alternatives return all alternative spellings of particular
        word(s). It will also return spelling which are not correct if there
        is rule like that in affix file.

    minimal
        This function returns minimal of all alternatives of a given
        word(s). It's a poor man's version of normalize (because we don't
        know gramatic of particular language, just some spelling rules).

PRIVATE METHODS
        Documented as being not documented.

EXAMPLES
        Please see the test.pl program in distribution which exercises some
        aspects of Alternative.pm.

BUGS
        There are no known bugs.
